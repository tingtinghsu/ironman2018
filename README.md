# Ironman2018 Project

I attended a competition "Writing IT articles in 30 days" held by a Taiwanese website IT help(IT邦幫忙). During that period I was in Sydney and started to get fimilair with Git, GitHub, Markdown syntax, Vcode IDE, Jekyll blog, Amason S3...and so on. Now I'm working toward to a professional Ruby on Rails developer.

## Start and Finish Date

2018-10-04 ~ 11-02 (30days)

## After the competition

I have moved to Osaka, Japan and decided to update the Ruby codes for Ironman2018 project and push to Github in December 2018.

It will be my Christmas Gift before a nice trip (Kobe/ Tokyo/ Hokkaido) in holiday season. ;)
